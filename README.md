Sentiment Analysis Project
This project is a sentiment analysis of COVID-19-related tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models. 
The goal is to classify tweets into five sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, Extremely Positive, Extremely Negative, and Neutral.

Project Overview
The project involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming textual data, including tokenization and padding sequences.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of sentiment distributions, word clouds, and location-based tweet analysis.
Modeling: Training an LSTM neural network with Keras for sentiment classification.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, F1-score, and loss metrics.
Key Features
Data Visualization: Sentiment distribution plots, word clouds, and geographic tweet mapping.
NLP Techniques: Text preprocessing, tokenization, and sequence padding.
Deep Learning Model: LSTM model for sentiment classification with training and validation analysis.
